## Description

**VerifyNow** - A comprehensive club management and financial tracking system built with NestJS. This application manages club memberships, financial transactions, expense tracking, and provides role-based access control for members and sub-members.

## Key Features

- **User Management**: Member and sub-member registration with invitation codes
- **Financial Tracking**: Budget management, expense tracking, and spending limits
- **Transaction System**: Club-based transactions with approval workflows
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for members vs sub-members
- **Report Generation**: Comprehensive PDF reports for financial analysis
- **Flag System**: Suspicious transaction flagging and audit trails
- **Email Integration**: User notifications and password reset functionality

## Architecture

- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: JSON Server (integrated) with file-based persistence
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **PDF Generation**: PDFKit for comprehensive reports
- **Email**: Nodemailer integration

## Project Setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the Application

The application now runs as a single process with integrated JSON Server functionality:

```bash
# development mode (recommended)
$ npm run dev

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run build
$ npm run start:prod

# debug mode
$ npm run start:debug
```

**Note**: The application runs on port 3000 and includes all JSON Server endpoints. No separate JSON Server process is needed.

## API Endpoints
